        <p>Welcome to Joshua Pane's Resume Website</p>

        <p>Here's A Few FAQ</p>

        <h3> <font size="6">Can you tell me a little about yourself? </font></h3>
        <p> So first off, my name is Joshua Pane. I am a senior computer science major at Baylor University.
        I grew up in Sugar Land, Texas (a suburb outside of Houston). I have 5 siblings, so a family of 8. I played rugby at St. Thomas highschool
        and was actually captain of my team during my senior year. I attend trivia in Waco on Thursday nights, and
        love a good road trip. </p>

        <h3> <font size="6">If you had to describe yourself as one kitchen utensil, what would it be and why? </font></h3>
        <p> Weird question I know, but you'd be surprised how often this gets asked. I personally see myself as a spork.
        I think the variety of uses, along with the repeated usability of a spork shows my willingness to adapt and my work ethic. </p>

        <h3> <font size="6">What is your mother's maiden name? Or the name of your first pet?</font></h3>
        <p> Uhhhhh, nice try</p>

        <h3> <font size="6">What makes you stand out?</font></h3>
        <p>Growing up in a big family I've always had to be social. I learned to live with many different personalities early on.
        My ability to get along with people of all personalities along with the technical skills I have learned are what make me stand out.</p>
