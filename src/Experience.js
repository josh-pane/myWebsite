      <p> As a Software Engineer Intern, I primarily assist the development team
      with tasks such as planning, writing, and testing of software. I am directly involved with all the phases of the development
       process and am required to communicate ideas effectively.
       </p>
       <p>As a Software QA intern, my toolkit includes: Java, Selenium Webdriver, Silk Test, Eclipse, and Jenkins
       to ensure proper functionality and integrity of the product. I automate the QA process through continuous integration software
        which emails error reports. I have automated testing for web, mobile, and desktop applications while at CBORD.</p>

      <p> As a Faculty Mentor for Baylor University, I help tutor freshman in the Computer Science department. I help teach them
      how to handle a college workload, understand the material being taught, and how to let loose every once in a while too.</p>
      <p> As a Cybersecurity TA I am responsible for setting up the practice scenarios every week along with helping the new students with labs.
      I set up virtual machines from FreeBSD to Ubuntu 8 to Windows 2012 Servers so that the Cybersecurity team can practice.</p>
